You’re about to implement C$50 Finance, a web app via which you can manage portfolios of stocks. Not only will this tool allow you to check real stocks’ actual prices and portfolios’ values, it will also let you buy (okay, “buy”) and sell (okay, “sell”) stocks by querying for stocks’ prices.

Indeed, there are tools (one is known as IEX) that let you download stock quotes via their API (application programming interface) using URLs like https://api.iex.cloud/v1/data/core/quote/nflx?token=API_KEY. Notice how Netflix’s symbol (NFLX) is embedded in this URL; that’s how IEX knows whose data to return. That link won’t actually return any data because IEX requires you to use an API key, but if it did, you’d see a response in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format like this:

Notice how, between the curly braces, there’s a comma-separated list of key-value pairs, with a colon separating each key from its value. We’re going to be doing something very similar, with Yahoo Finance.
